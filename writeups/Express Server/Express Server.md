Setting up a simple Express API server involves a few steps. Here's a basic guide to get you started:

1. Initialize a new Node.js project: Open a terminal and create a new directory for your project. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:
    
    shell
    

- `npm init -y`
    
    This command will create a `package.json` file with default configurations.
    
- Install Express: Install the Express package by running the following command:
    
    shell
    
- `npm install express`
    
- Create an Express server file: Create a new file, for example, `server.js`, to define and configure your Express server.
    
    
```javascript
    
-const express = require('express');  const app = express(); const port = 3000; // Replace with your desired port number  // Define your routes and middleware here  app.listen(port, () => {   console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`); });``
    
    In this example, we import the Express module, create an instance of the Express application, and define the port on which the server will listen for incoming requests.
    
- Define routes and middleware: Inside the `server.js` file, you can define your routes and middleware to handle incoming requests and perform necessary actions. Here's an example of a simple route:
    
    javascript
    
- `// Example route app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {   res.json({ message: 'Hello, world!' }); });`
    
    In this example, we define a GET route `/api/hello` that sends a JSON response with the message "Hello, world!".
    
    You can add more routes, including POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., to handle different types of requests.
    
- Start the server: Finally, run the following command in the terminal to start your Express server:
    
    shell
    

`node server.js`

You should see the message "Server is running on port 3000" (or your specified port) in the console.
